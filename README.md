# Smart Dog Collar Project

This repository documents the conceptual development of a smart dog collar for COMM 4190. The goal was to leverage a large language model (LLM) as a collaborative partner to brainstorm and refine a new product idea from its initial concept to launching a website.

## Collaborators
- Caroline Cummings using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Emily Lo using ChatGPT 5.0

## Project Overview
The core idea was a smart dog collar, a device similar to a human smartwatch. We envisioned it monitoring a dog's vitals—like heart rate, steps, and sleep—and its location via GPS. This data would be accessible to dog owners through a mobile app, allowing them to proactively monitor their pet's health and promote a healthy lifestyle.

## Process & Methodology
The development process was a conversational, iterative dialogue with the AI. We had the following deliverables:
- A refined product description.
- A list of potential product names and slogans.
- A breakdown of key product features.
- A comprehensive marketing strategy.

## Reflection
This project demonstrates AI's role as a tool for creative and strategic collaboration. By engaging in dialogue, we were able to quickly develop a well-defined plan from a simple product concept.
