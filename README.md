# Smart Dog Collar Project

This repository documents the conceptual development of a smart dog collar for COMM 4190. The goal was to leverage a large language model (LLM) as a collaborative partner to brainstorm and refine a new product idea from its initial concept to launching a website.

## Project Overview
The core idea was a smart dog collar, a device similar to a human smartwatch. We envisioned it monitoring a dog's vitals—like heart rate, steps, and sleep—and its location via GPS. This data would be accessible to dog owners through a mobile app, allowing them to proactively monitor their pet's health and promote a healthy lifestyle.
